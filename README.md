# Traveling Salesman Problem using Held-Karp algorithm approach

Held-Karp algorithm has a better time complexity compared to brute force for larger instances of the problem.

In this solution, the distances matrix represents the distances between different cities. The Held-Karp algorithm uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently compute the optimal solution. It's important to note that while the Held-Karp algorithm is more efficient than brute force, it still has exponential time complexity and can become slow for a large number of cities.

For even larger instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem, more advanced techniques such as approximation algorithms (like the Christofides algorithm) or metaheuristic methods (like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or ant colony optimization) might be more suitable.
